# Project 3 — Polynomial Regression (sklearn)

A hands-on implementation of Polynomial Regression using scikit-learn. Polynomial feature expansion lets a simple linear model learn curved relationships while remaining easy to train, interpret, and compare against the earlier linear projects.

## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates how polynomial feature expansion (`x, x², x³, …, xᵈ`) enables linear regression to fit non-linear relationships. It compares different polynomial degrees to illustrate underfitting, good fit, and overfitting, and highlights how scikit-learn handles feature expansion and closed-form regression efficiently.

## ✨ Features

- **Polynomial Feature Expansion**: Uses `PolynomialFeatures` to create non-linear terms.
- **Multiple Degrees Compared**: Trains degrees 1, 2, 3, and 10 to show under/overfitting.
- **Fast Training**: Relies on scikit-learn’s analytical OLS solution.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Train/Test MSE and R² across degrees.
- **Visualization**: Plots fitted curves for each degree alongside data.
- **Reproducible Data**: Synthetic cubic dataset with fixed random seed.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for plots)

## 🚀 Usage

### 1) Train all models

```bash
python train.py
```

Outputs coefficients and intercepts for degrees 1, 2, 3, 10.

### 2) Evaluate model performance

```bash
python eval.py
```

Outputs Train/Test MSE and R² for each degree.

### 3) Visualize fitted curves

```bash
python plots.py
```

Displays and can save `plots.png` with curves for all degrees.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

### Polynomial Feature Expansion
- Transforms `X` into `[x, x², x³, …]` via `PolynomialFeatures(degree, include_bias=False)`.
- `include_bias=False` avoids duplicating the intercept term already handled by `LinearRegression`.

### Synthetic Data
- Function: `y = 0.5x³ - 2x² + 3x + 5 + noise`.
- Generation: `np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)` with Gaussian noise; `np.random.seed(42)` for reproducibility.
- Purpose: Controlled environment to observe under/overfitting on a known cubic relationship.

### Underfitting vs Overfitting
- Low degree (1): Too simple, misses curvature.
- Moderate degree (3): Matches true pattern well.
- High degree (10): Wiggly curve that memorizes noise.

### Bias–Variance Intuition
- Increasing degree lowers bias but raises variance.
- Model selection uses validation/test metrics, not just training error.

## 🔎 Degree Selection & Model Behavior

| Degree | Shape       | Behavior   |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| 1      | Line        | ❌ Underfit |
| 2      | Parabola    | 👍 Good     |
| 3      | Cubic       | ⭐ Best Fit |
| 10     | Highly wavy | ⚠️ Overfit  |

Practical takeaway: choose the degree that minimizes test error and generalizes (here, degree 3).

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **Train MSE / Test MSE**: Error on train vs. held-out data.
- **R² Score**: Variance explained; closer to 1 is better.
- **Inference Time (optional)**: Polynomial terms add cost, but small degrees remain fast.

## 🧪 Example Results

From the provided synthetic run:

| Degree | Train MSE | Test MSE | R² Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| 1      | 326.64    | 455.62   | 0.712    | ❌ Underfit    |
| 2      | 137.29    | 143.74   | 0.909    | 👍 Good        |
| 3      | 81.60     | 60.22    | 0.962    | ⭐ Best        |
| 10     | 74.93     | 81.73    | 0.948    | ⚠️ Overfit     |

Selected model: **Degree 3** (best generalization, matches true cubic pattern).

## 🖼️ Visualizations

`plots.py` plots data points plus fitted curves for degrees 1, 2, 3, 10:
- Degree 1 → underfits (straight line)
- Degree 3 → natural, smooth S-shape (best)
- Degree 10 → wiggly, captures noise (overfits)

Save or view the generated figure as `plots.png`.

## 🎓 Why Project 3 Matters

- Connects linear models to non-linear patterns via feature engineering.
- Illustrates bias–variance trade-off using degree as complexity control.
- Validates scikit-learn workflows after scratch and basic sklearn linear regression.
- Prepares for regularization (controlling overfitting) and more complex models.

## 🌟 Next Steps

**Project 4 — Ridge & Lasso Regression**
- Apply L2 (Ridge) and L1 (Lasso) regularization to stabilize high-degree models.
- Control large coefficients and reduce overfitting (especially for degree 10).
- Learn how to tune regularization strength (`alpha`) and compare outcomes.
